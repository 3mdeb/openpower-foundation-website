"Large Memory Server Design Overview"
Abstract:
With the advancement of AI workloads and their increasingly large data set requirements, the need for high memory capacity and density is becoming paramount for the industry.  There have been advances in memory connectivity that promise to deliver solutions that will meet these needs.  This specification shows a design that utilizes two of these technologies, OpenCAPI Memory Interface (OMI) and Compute Express Link (CXL), to deliver from 24TB to a potentially jaw-dropping 32TB of memory in an air-cooled, single socket OCP DC-MHS inspired 19’’ 2U chassis.  This design solution, a collaboration between the OpenPower Foundation, Jabil Inc.,Raptor Computing Systems, SAP, and Wooden Data Center, is currently in the design phase.  In this specification, physical limitations, interconnects, and power/thermal constraints will be highlighted.  The end goal would be to contribute this design specification to the OCP community.
