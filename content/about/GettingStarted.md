OpenPOWER Getting Started Guide 

# OpenPOWER Foundation

The [OpenPOWER](https://openpowerfoundation.org) Foundation develops high-quality, open source hardware designs and open source hardware design tools relevant to silicon devices and FPGAs.

By creating an open and collaborative environment, the OpenPOWER Foundation shares resources to lower the cost of development. Companies and individuals can work together to develop open source POWER based CPUs, peripherals, and open source software.

The OpenPOWER Foundation is open to all organizations and individuals who are interested in collaborating on open source hardware or software to accelerate the development and adoption of the OpenPOWER ISA and its related technologies.

The OpenPOWER Foundation is a separate entity under the [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org), and is a 501(c)6 non-profit.


## Getting Started

The OpenPOWER Foundation (OPF) has overhauled its entire infrastructure to better serve the needs of our community. We have implemented a number of new systems that will make it easier for both members and non-members to engage and collaborate with the OPF. All of the systems OPF uses are fully OSS running on PPC64LE POWER servers.

This guide is to provide the community an introduction to our infrastructure and communication channels and how to easily engage. 

Here are the first things you should do to get involved. 

### Check if your Organization is already a Member

OPF is open to all, but some of our workgroups and material are for members only. 

To check if your company is a member, head over to our [members page](https://openpowerfoundation.org/members/). If your company is already a member, than [sign up for your OPF passport](https://openpowerfoundation.org/passport/). The OPF passport is used to access ALL materials and channels within the OPF.

If you would like to become a member please review our [membership benefits page](https://openpowerfoundation.org/join/) and follow the [link to sign up](https://enrollment.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/?project=openpowerfoundation) as a member. 

### Connect with us

We recommend you join our OPF Discuss forum, as it is the primary means of communication.  The OpenPOWER Foundation hosts our own [Discourse server](https://discuss.openpower.foundation/). You can sign up and access all of the workgroups, birds of feather, and special integration workgroups. 
_*Note that some of the workgroups are open to members only._

## How to participate in the Technical Community


The main area of collaboration occurs within our Workgroups. The [Workgroup page](https://openpowerfoundation.org/groups/) lists out the current OPF working groups. 

Clicking on one of the workgroups brings you to the main area explaining what the workgroup focuses on, who is the current chair, along with the associated resource links to engage. Depending on the workgroup these links might be private for members only and will require you to login using your OPF Passport ID.

Participation in the development and decision-making process is open to anybody in the technical community.  We strongly encourage developers to engage with our projects directly on a technical level.

### About the Technical Steering Committee

The TSC governs all technical workgroups. [OpenPOWER Foundation TSC ](https://openpowerfoundation.org/steeringcommittee/). 

The TSC is comprised of technical representatives from OpenPOWER Foundation workgroups, and led by a chairperson.  All OPF members with the technical community are welcome to join TSC meetings.



## How to participate as a Member

The OpenPOWER Foundation is a **member-supported** organization.  [Our members](https://openpowerfoundation.org/members/) provide 100% of the financial support for our activities. This enables us to host technical workshops and other events to drive innovation around the POWER architecture. 

### First steps for new members

After becoming a new [member](https://openpowerfoundation.org/members/).  Please

### The Governing Board

In addition, the Board of Directors is responsible for managing the organization's budget.

The Board of Directors meets monthly.
