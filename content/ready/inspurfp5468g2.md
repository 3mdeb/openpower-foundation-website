The Inpur FP5468G2 is a 4U Dual-socket POWER9 Rack Server.
- Superior system computing power
	- Support 8 V100 or 20 T4 GPUs to provide full-field superior heterogeneous computing power
	- Support 2 POWER9 Sforza processors with up to 44 cores and 176 threads, providing superior scheduling capability
	- Tuning for specific deep learning models, performance up to 20% compared to equivalent X86 platforms
	- Fully compatible with FPGA/AISC, providing application-specific acceleration
- Ultra-high computing density for significant TCO savings
	- Compared to regular 2U 4GPU servers, double computing density
	- Supporting the same number of GPUs and comparing to lower-density GPU server cluster , FP5468G2 space saved by 50%, power saved by 23%, measured computing power increased by 8%, price reduced by 34%, for 500 server clusters can save TCO over 10 million dollars
- Flexible heterogeneous topology
	- Support three topologies – balance, common and cascade
	- Flexible topology switching based on application scenarios/training models
- Efficient , high-volume local storage and high-speed IO expansion
	- Support up to 24 3.5”hard drives, 6 of which support U.2 NVMe SSD providing high read and write speed
	- Support 4 standard PCIe x16 slots, providing 100Gb RDMA high speed network
