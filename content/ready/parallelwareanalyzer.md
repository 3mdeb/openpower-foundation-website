Parallelware Analyzer is a suite of command-line tools aimed at helping software developers to build better quality parallel software in less time.
Designed around the needs of developers, Parallelware Analyzer provides the appropriate tools for the key stages of the parallel development workflow,
aiding developers with code analysis that would otherwise be error-prone and completed manually.
It can also be easily integrated with DevOp tools to benefit from its automatic usage during Continuous Integration.

The unmatched state-of-the-art static code analysis capabilities of the Parallelware technology address the complexity of
parallelism from three different perspectives :
- finding parallel defects in the code
- discovering new opportunities for parallelization in the code
- generating parallel-equivalent code that enables tasks to complete in less time

The Parallelware analysis completes quickly and enables real-time static code analysis for the development of correct parallel software.
