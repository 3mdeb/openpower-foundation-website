The MegaRAIDÂ® SAS 9380-8i8e, with eight internal and eight external ports in a low-profile form factor, delivers two 1.2 GHz PowerPC processor cores
and a 72-bit DDR3 interface that drives 2 GB cache memory.
Powered by the SAS3316 dual-core ROC, with 16 native SAS/SATA ports, the 9380-8i8e controller can take full advantage of
the latest PCI Express 3.0 interface to provide higher performance and increased throughput. The 12 Gb/s MegaRAID SAS 9380-8i8e is
designed to direct connect eight drives inside the box or eight drives outside the box.
By leveraging SAS expander technology, users can expand to up to 240 drives increasing inside the box drive count or
through supporting external JBOD storage enclosures.
