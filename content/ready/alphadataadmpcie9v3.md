The ADM-PCIE-9V3 is a half-length, low profile, PCI Express Add-In Card featuring the powerful and efficient Xilinx Virtex UltraScale Plus VU3P-2 FPGA.

The ADM-PCIE-9V3 features a 16 lane PCIe Gen3 or 8 lane Gen4 capable interface, which allows for maximum data throughput.
The ADM-PCIE-9V3 is equipped with front IO via 2x QSFP28 sockets, each supporting one 100GbE or four 25GbE interfaces.
Full profile card slots can also support two additional 100GbE interfaces via Samtec FireFlyÂ® modules,
allowing this board to become a massive network device with 4x 100GbE ports.
The board also includes two 1G x72 DDR4-2400 ECC memory banks each provide 8GiB of on-board DDR4-2400 memory (72 bits wide).
System monitoring of temperature, voltage, and current gives developers accurate feedback of power utilization for their designs.
An optional Board Support Package (BSP) with example FPGA designs, application software, mature Application Programming Interface (API) and
driver support for MS Windows and Linux is available.
The ADC-PCIE-9V3 comes with low-profile and full-height front brackets (low-profile bracket fitted as standard) and
an optional blower for low air-flow systems.
