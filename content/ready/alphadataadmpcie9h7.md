The ADM-PCIE-9H7 is a high-performance FPGA processing card intended for data center applications using
Virtex UltraScale+ High Bandwidth Memory FPGAs from Xilinx.

The ADM-PCIE-9H7 utilizes the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale Plus FPGA family that includes on substrate High Bandwidth Memory (HBM Gen2).
This provides exceptional memory Read/Write performance while reducing the overall power consumption of the board
by negating the need for external SDRAM devices.
There are also a large number of high speed interface options available including 100G Ethernet MACs,
150G Interlaken cores and multiple PCI Express cores.
To make the most of these interfaces the ADM-PCIE-9H7 is fitted with 4 QSFP28 Cages,
up to 8 Firefly interfaces (each 4x 28Gbps) and two OpenCAPI interfaces for ultra low latency communications.
