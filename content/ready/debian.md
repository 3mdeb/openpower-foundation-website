Little Endian (LE) Linux supporting the 64-bit POWER Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is a foundational part of
the OpenPOWER System software stack and supports the development of OpenPOWER applications
including future applications leveraging NVIDIA GPUs.
The development community will now benefit from the creation of an open source software community for the development
of a new ppc64el port, a Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
To view additional information about this porting effort including how to access the repository of binaries and pre-installed images,
visit Debian-ppc mailing list on the Debian wiki.
To report bugs or other issues related to the Debian ppc64el tool as work begins in this community,
developers are encouraged to join the debian-ppc mailing list or use the Debian bug reporting site at Debian bug reporting site.
