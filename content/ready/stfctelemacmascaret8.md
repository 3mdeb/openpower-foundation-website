The TELEMAC-MASCARET system is a powerful integrated modelling tool for use in the field of free-surface flows.
Having been used in the context of very many studies throughout the world (several hundred to date),
it has become one of the major standards in its field.

The various simulation modules use high-capacity algorithms based on the finite-element method.
Space is discretised in the form of an unstructured grid of triangular elements,
which means that it can be refined particularly in areas of special interest.
Parallelization on distributed memory machines is handled by MPI.
