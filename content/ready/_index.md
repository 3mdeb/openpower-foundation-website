OpenPOWER Ready is a mark used by the OpenPOWER Foundation to enable ecosystem product developers
to indicate their product has been shown, demonstrated to meet a minimum set of characteristics and
should be interoperable with other OpenPOWER Ready products.
The mark attests that a specific component satisfies the criteria defined in a specific version of the OpenPOWER Ready Criteria Document.
