Codee is a software development tool that provides automated code inspection specifically designed to improve the performance of C/C++/Fortran applications.  
It provides a systematic predictable approach to optimize C/C++/Fortran source code for the target environment.  
The tool scans the C/C++/Fortran source code without executing it, and produces a report for the developer indicating the issue,
its location, why it penalizes performance, and how to fix it in order to make the code run faster.  
It is designed to interoperate with CI/CD systems.

Codee provides a performance optimization report with human-readable actionable items : opportunities, recommendations, defects and remarks.  
It annotates CPU and GPU codes with OpenMP, OpenACC and compiler-specific directives.  
It also detects defects in these directives, enabling the early detection of race conditions and data movement issues.
