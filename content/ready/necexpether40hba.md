The NEC Corporation ExpEther 40G Host Bus Adapter, N8104-165, is a HBA for high speed ethernet.

The technology innovation of ExpEther expands the power of the PCI Express switch beyond
the computer chassis via Ethernet without modification of existing hardware and software.
ExpEther 40G devices delivers a compelling solution for real-time Big Data processing and
other data center workload acceleration. It does so by enabling the connection of
GPGPU, NVMe SSD, or FPGA-based accelerators via an Ethernet connection.
