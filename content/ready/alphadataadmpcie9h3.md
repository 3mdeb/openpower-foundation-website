The ADM-PCIE-9H3 is a high-performance FPGA processing card intended for data center applications using
Virtex UltraScale+ High Bandwidth Memory FPGAs from Xilinx.

The ADM-PCIE-9H3 utilises the Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale Plus FPGA family that includes on substrate High Bandwidth Memory (HBM Gen2).
This provides exceptional memory Read/Write performance while reducing the overall power consumption of
the board by negating the need for external SDRAM devices.
There are also a number of high speed interface options available including 100G Ethernet MACs and OpenCAPI connectivity,
to make the most of these interfaces the ADM-PCIE-9H3 is fitted with a QSFP-DD Cage (8x28Gbps lanes) and
one OpenCAPI interface for ultra low latency communications.
