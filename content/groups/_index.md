At the foundation we have 2 different distinct types of working groups.  


A __Technical Workgroup (TWG)__ is a workgroup that provides technical specifications and will help define next-generation of the specifications,
definitions, and the compliance of these specifications with primary output being specification documents.  


A __Special Integration Group (SIG)__ is a workgroup that provides an implementation of technical specifications with the goal to produce reference designs.
A SIG will normally provide a reference design, a finished product, or help maintain project for direct usage.
