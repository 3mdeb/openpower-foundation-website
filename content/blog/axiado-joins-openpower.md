Today, we are pleased to announce that [Axiado Corporation](https://axiado.com/), an AI-enhanced hardware security company based in San Jose, CA, has joined the OpenPOWER Foundation as a Silver member.

The OpenPOWER Foundation is committed to an open, community-driven technology development process, which is critical to the continued growth of open collaboration around the POWER architecture.

“_OpenPOWER Foundation is pleased to welcome Axiado to the foundation and our community, and look forward to our collaboration in the open trusted compute solution space_”, said [James Kulina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-kulina/), Executive Director, OpenPOWER Foundation. “Axiado’s datacenter-ready secure control module (DC-SCM) Smart SCM solution was inspired by OpenPOWER’s very own LibreBMC project. The rapid adoption and iteration from a fully open community-driven solution, is exactly what the foundation champions.”

Axiado develops trusted control/compute security processors and management platforms. Axiado’s solution provides protection to critical infrastructures and effectively fends off remote network- and local physical-based attacks. It is ideally suited to providing protection for datacenters and mobile networks.

“_This is an important milestone for Axiado as it highlights our commitment to the Foundation and greater technical collaboration_”, said [Gopi Sirineni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopisirineni/), Axiado’s President & CEO. “Axiado Smart SCM fills several gaps in the market by eliminating fundamental security problems, like ransomware, via its ground-up built and integrated solution that minimizes the attack surface in distributed, multi-tenant cloud infrastructures.”

[Josel Lorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josel/), Axiado’s VP of Products continues, “_Open ecosystem design has empowered start-ups such as Axiado to innovate with next generation capabilities previously not possible. Our Smart SCM, powered by TCU and based on the DC-SCM specification, illustrates what’s possible with open collaboration and how it can enhance server security._”

The OpenPOWER Foundation looks forward to collaborating with Axiado in developing new and exciting security processors for POWER-based platforms through open standards and community driven collaboration.
