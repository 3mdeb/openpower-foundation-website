E4’s mission, to drive innovation by implementing and integrating cutting-edge solutions with the best performance for every high-end computing and storage requirement, is very much our focus for this year’s edition of ISC. We chose to [showcase](http://cms-it.e4company.com/media/35466/e4pr-accelerated-openpower-system-by-e4-computer-engineering-showcased-a.pdf) a number of systems at our booth, #914, based on one of the most advanced technologies available at the moment: accelerated POWER8 technology.

## Showcasing OpenPOWER Servers

E4’s solutions at ISC16 represents a consistent alternative to standard x86 technology by providing the scientific and industrial researchers with fast performances for their complex processing applications.

Our newest system, OP205 is our most advanced POWER8-based server designed for high performance computing and big data. It includes coherent accelerator processor interface (CAPI) enabled PCIe slots, and can host two NVIDIA K80 GPUs. Both technologies are designed to accelerate application performance with the POWER8 CPU.

## Building Faster Servers with NVLink

In addition, the OP Series is powered by the [NVIDIA Tesla Accelerated Computing Platform](http://www.nvidia.com/object/why-choose-tesla.html) and two out of the three solutions on display at our booth utilize the new [NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) with the high-bandwidth NVIDIA NVLink™ interconnect technology, which dramatically speeds up throughput and maximizes application performance.

We are confident that the series can be a perfect match for complex workloads like in Oil & Gas, Finance, Big Data and all compute-intensive applications.

We look forward to meet anyone attending the Conference who is interested in starting to get familiar with OpenPOWER. To do so, you just need to pop by booth #914 and our team will talk you through the various options.

We see ISC as a perfect venue to launch this technology with the opportunity to talk to the people who may  benefit from it, to find out from them theapplications and codes that are most needed.
