### Presentation objective

PGI Fortran, C and C++ compilers & tools are used on Linux/x86 processor-based systems at over 5000 high-performance computing (HPC) sites around the world.  They are distinguished by HPC-focused optimizations including automatic SIMD vectorization, and extensive support for parallel and accelerator programming models and languages including OpenMP, OpenACC and CUDA.  The objective of this talk is to give an overview of the forthcomingPGI compilers for OpenPOWER platforms, which will enable seamless migration of multi-core and GPU-enabled HPC applications from Linux/x86 to OpenPOWER and performance portability of HPC applications.

### **Abstract**

High-performance computing (HPC) systems are now built around a de facto node architecture with high-speed latency-optimized SIMD-capable CPUs coupled to massively parallel bandwidth-optimized Accelerators.  In recent years, as many as 90% of the Top 500 Computing systems relied entirely on x86 CPU-based systems.   OpenPOWER and the increasing success of Accelerator-based systems offer an alternative that promises unrivalled multi-core CPU performance and closer coupling of CPUs and GPUs through technologies like NVIDIA’s NVLink high-speed interconnect.  PGIFortran/C/C++ compilers, until now available exclusively on x86 CPU-based systems, are distinguished by a focus on HPC features and optimizations such as automatic SIMD vectorization and support for high-level parallel and GPU programming. This talk will give an overview of the forthcoming PGI compilers for POWER+GPU processor-based systems, including features for seamless migration of applications from Linux/x86 to Linux/POWER and performance portability across all mainstream HPC systems.
