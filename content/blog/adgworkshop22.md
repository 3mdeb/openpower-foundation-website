Since its founding in 2013, OpenPOWER Foundation membership has grown to more than 300+ members, including over 100 academic members; the latter formed the Academic Bird of a Feather (BoF) group.  
This group has run several workshops worldwide enabling students, professors and developers in chip development to AI, hybrid cloud, and big data solutions.  
The ADG group hosted its 8th workshop at the SC22 conference in Dallas on Nov 12th 2022.

During a packed one day event, presenters from academia and industry examined progress and opportunities to leverage OpenPOWER technology.  
The workshop’s primary goals, say organizers, were to facilitate networking and improve technical knowledge of ADG members on relevant OpenPOWER capabilities.  
The event also provided a platform for commercial OpenPOWER members to explore opportunities for collaboration with ADG members. 
Workshop conveners included Prof Dr Sameer Shende (Research Professor and Performance Lab Director at University of Oregon), Ganesan Narayanasamy (OpenPOWER Academia BoF Chair).

Representatives from IBM, University of Oregon, Virginia Tech, Oregon State University, UT Dallas, Werner Enterprises, Ohio State University, Object Automation System Solutions, NJIT,
Intel, X-Scale Solutions, TU-DELFT, University of Michigan and many more discussed their contributions to the OpenPOWER ecosystem.  
The presentations coverered a range of topics, including POWER processor architecture, performance engineering, open source base board management controller, enterprise AI solutions,
distributed deep learning, along with development and scalability of application for AI and HPC.  

There was even a special session about OpenPOWER Hub, with two Hub providers, the University of Oregon and Oregon State Unviersity, showcased how students,
researchers and developers can get access to the hub and collaborate on developing applications using the POWER platform.

OpenPOWER is a member driven ecosystem, where one can consume, contribute, and collaborate to develop a complete secure open platform.
As summarized by Dr Sameer Shende, “_Member companies are enabled to customize POWER processors and system platforms for optimization and innovation for their business needs.
These innovations include development of custom systems and processor for special super computers, or advanced hardware technology exploitation._”
