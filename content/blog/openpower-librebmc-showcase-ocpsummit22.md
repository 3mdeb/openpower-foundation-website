OpenPOWER Foundation to showcase _LibreBMC_, a fully open-source POWER-based BMC at OCP Global Summit.  

SAN JOSE, CA — Oct. 18, 2022  — [OpenPOWER Foundation](https://openpowerfoundation.org),
an open developer community for the POWER ISA, will demonstrate a full demo of LibreBMC,
an open source baseboard management controller (BMC) solution at the [2022 Open Compute Project (OCP) Global Summit](https://www.opencompute.org/summit/global-summit).
This follows on from the project’s [announcement](https://openpowerfoundation.org/blog/openpower-foundation-announces-librebmc-a-power-based-fully-open-source-bmc/) at last year's OCP Global Summit.  

BMCs enable remote monitoring and access to servers.
They underpin the ability for hyperscalers and enterprise data centers to efficiently manage their fleet of servers safely and securely.
Historically, BMCs are built using legacy proprietary and closed architectures. 

The OpenPOWER Foundation is pleased to showcase a full [demo](https://youtu.be/YYNegXDsRoU) of the LibreBMC project,
a BMC solution with a completely open source stack of hardware, software, specifications, and tooling.
The solution as shown uses a processor called [Microwatt](https://github.com/antonblanchard/microwatt),
a community developed softcore based on the fully open [POWER ISA](https://openpowerfoundation.org/specifications/isa/).
It runs the [OpenBMC](https://www.openbmc.org/) firmware, a [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org) project,
and the platform adheres to the [Open Compute Project’s](https://www.opencompute.org/) [DC-SCM specification](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-dc-scm-spec-rev-1-0-pdf).
LibreBMC was built using open-source tooling and with open source peripheral IP such as [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex).  

[LibreBMC](https://openpowerfoundation.org/groups/librebmc/) is an open-source community project guided by the OPF Special Integration Group of the same name.
The project details, including links to all source code and documentation, can be found [here](https://git.openpower.foundation/librebmc/librebmc).
It also has inspired [Axiado Corporation](https://axiado.com/), an AI-enhanced hardware security company,
and [new OpenPOWER Foundation Silver member](https://openpowerfoundation.org/blog/axiado-joins-openpower/),
to develop their own datacenter-ready secure control module (DC-SCM), Smart SCM solution, utilizing both the POWER ISA and OpenBMC firmware.
Axiado will also be demoing their solution at the OpenPOWER booth.

Axiado’s President and CEO [Gopi Sirineni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopisirineni/) added,
“_This is an important milestone for Axiado as it highlights our commitment to the Foundation and greater technical collaboration.
Open ecosystem design has empowered start-ups such as Axiado to innovate with next generation capabilities previously not possible.
Our demonstration illustrates what’s possible with open collaboration and how our Smart SCM, powered by TCU, can be used to enhance server security._”

“_The community-driven LibreBMC solution demonstrates the kind and pace of innovation that occurs when open collaboration is placed front and center_,”
said [James Kulina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-kulina/), executive director, OpenPOWER Foundation.
“_LibreBMC proves that for a critical infrastructure component such as the baseboard management controller,
an open platform supported by an active community enables improved performance, reliability, customization, and security._”

Bijan Nowroozi, Chief Technology Officer for the [Open Compute Project Foundation](https://www.opencompute.org/),
said "_Speaking on behalf of the OCP Community, we are excited to see the progress of OpenPOWER’s LibreBMC project,
which utilizes OCP's DC-SCM standard that provides a wonderful open interface for platform resilience, management and orchestration capability,
and enables OpenPOWER’s LibreBMC, to increase security and transparency for a next level BMC that supports POWER, ARM and x86 based systems._"
