Today, we are pleased to announce that Solid Silicon, a fabless semiconductor company based in Colorado, US, has joined the OpenPOWER Foundation as a Platinum member.  

The OpenPOWER Foundation is committed to an open, community-driven technology development process, which is critical to the continued growth of open collaboration around the POWER architecture.  

"_OpenPOWER Foundation is pleased to welcome Solid Silicon to the foundation and our community, and looks forward to our collaboration in community-driven open development that broadens customer computing choice_", said [James Kulina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-kulina/), Executive Director, OpenPOWER Foundation.  

Solid Silicon Corporation is developing open source software and secure chip designs based on standardized, self-sovereign, future-proof silicon to give developers the ability to own, control, and trust their computing devices down to the silicon.  

Solid Silicon  currently is [developing](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/solid-silicon_raptor-computing-sys-on-x-activity-7121183443475992576-kq_A?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) two new silicon devices based on the OpenPOWER ISA.  The first is the X-class chip line that targets Edge/IoT applications while the second line, the S-class chip, targets Data Center applications. Both chip lines will adopt the latest POWER ISA 3.1 specifications leading to new product capabilities within the OpenPOWER ecosystem.

"_Solid Silicon's OpenPOWER CPUs are built on and fully comply with the open, standardized POWER ISA administered by the OpenPOWER Foundation. This commitment to open standards ensures that our customers benefit from the latest advancements in processor technology, while also providing the transparency and security that comes from an open and unified software ecosystem.  In our view, the vendor-neutral approach to ISA standardization that the OpenPOWER Foundation provides is crucial to both avoiding vendor lock-in and ensuring a diverse software ecosystem while simultaneously ensuring long-term application compatibility._", said [Tim Pearson](https://www.linkedin.com/company/solid-silicon/), CTO and Founder.

"_At a fundamental level, akin to public cryptography, the entire OpenPOWER architecture and standard are open, auditable, and completely verifiable. With Solid Silicon's firmware, software, and tools also being fully open source, our customers benefit immensely by deploying self-sovereign silicon solutions from the edge to the data center. We are thrilled to partner with the OpenPOWER Foundation to foster and expand this incredible developer community_", says [Todd Rooke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddrooke/), CEO and Founder.  

The OpenPOWER Foundation looks forward to collaborating with Solid Silicon
in developing new and exciting POWER based silicon through open standards and community driven collaboration.
