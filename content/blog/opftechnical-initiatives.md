### Abstract

As the Chair of the OpenPOWER Technical Steering Committee Mr. Brown will be discussing the technical agenda of the OpenPOWER Foundation and the structure of foundation workgroups.  He will describe the scope and objectives of key workgroups as well as their relationships to each other.  A roadmap of workgroup activities will illustrate when the community can expect key results.  The presentation will also cover three of the key initiatives within the OpenPOWER Foundation.  These initiatives involve work recently started to enable active foundation member engagement in workgroups focused on application solution sets IO device enablement, and compliance.  Mr. Brown will be joined by Randall Ross of Canonical who will cover application solution sets,  Rakesh Sharma of IBM who will cover broader IO device enablement, and Sandy Woodword of IBM who is the chair of the compliance workgroup .  Please join us for this in depth look at the OpenPOWER Foundation's technical activities and how we will enable ecosystem members to deliver solutions.
