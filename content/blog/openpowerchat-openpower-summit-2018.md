Robbie Williamson, Chair of the Board, OpenPOWER Foundation

Last week was a special occasion: the OpenPOWER Foundation hosted its first Twitter Chat – moderated by yours truly and our Executive Director Hugh Blemings. We focused on the upcoming OpenPOWER Summit and the innovations and collaboration that OpenPOWER members have developed.

In case you weren’t able to attend and participate, here is a recap of the conversation. Don’t forget to [register for OpenPOWER Summit 2018 here](https://openpowerfoundation.org/summit-2018-03-us/)!
