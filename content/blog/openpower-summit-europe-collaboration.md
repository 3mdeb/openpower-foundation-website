I recently attended the [OpenPOWER Summit Europe](https://openpowerfoundation.org/summit-2018-10-eu/) in Amsterdam.

Organized by the OpenPOWER Foundation, a group founded in 2013, the Summit is an excellent platform for exchanging ideas and enabling foundation member organizations and data centers to rethink their approach to technology and ways to customize POWER CPU processors and system platforms for optimization and innovation for their business needs. The systems under consideration include those for large or warehouse scale data centers, workload acceleration through GPU, FPGA or advanced I/O, platform optimization for SW appliances, or advanced hardware technology exploitation.

The event had a strong technical emphasis and gave many developers, engineers, executives, decision makers and researchers the opportunity to learn from and work together over the course of two days. Presentation topics included PCIe Gen4, CAPI, OpenCAPI, Linux, OpenBMC, GPU, FPGA, I/O, Power Architecture, performance optimization, system management and more.

I found the sessions below to be particularly interesting. [Click here to view](https://openpowerfoundation.org/summit-2018-10-eu/) presentations from these sessions and more.

- Executive Remarks, Artem Ikoev
- Why Innovation Matters: The Power to Save Power, Fabrizio Magugliani
- FPGA-OpenPOWER Academic Work Group, Ganesan Narayanasam
- TAU for Accelerating AI Applications, Sameer Shende
- FPGA-OpenCAPI and its Roadmap, Myron Slota

The AI4Good and OpenBMC Hackathons held during the Summit were well attended and attracted young developers.

I’m already looking forward to the next opportunity to meet, learn from and collaborate with OpenPOWER members in Europe.
