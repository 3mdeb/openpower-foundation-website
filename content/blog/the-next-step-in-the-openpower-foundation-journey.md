[Hugh Blemings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugh-blemings/?originalSubdomain=au), Executive Director, OpenPOWER Foundation

Today marks one of the most important days in the life of the OpenPOWER Foundation. With IBM announcing new contributions to the open source community including the POWER Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and key hardware reference designs at [OpenPOWER Summit North America 2019](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/openpower-summit-north-america-2019/), the future has never looked brighter for the POWER architecture. 

## **OpenPOWER Foundation Aligns with Linux Foundation**

The OpenPOWER Foundation will now join projects and organizations like OpenBMC, CHIPS Alliance, OpenHPC and so many others within the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). The Linux Foundation is the premier open source group, and we’re excited to be working more closely with them.

Since our founding in 2013, IEEE-ISTO has been our home, and we owe so much to its team. It’s as a result of IEEE-ISTO’s support and guidance that we’ve been able to expand to more than 350 members and that we’re ready to take the next step in our evolution. On behalf of our membership, our board of directors and myself, we place on record our thanks to the IEEE-ISTO team. 

By moving the POWER ISA under an open model - guided by the OpenPOWER Foundation within the Linux Foundation - and making it available to the growing open technical commons, we’ll enable innovation in the open hardware and software space to grow at an accelerated pace. The possibilities for what organizations and individuals will be able to develop on POWER through its mature ISA and software ecosystem will be nearly limitless.

## **The Impact of an Open POWER ISA and Open Source Designs**

We’ve heard in the past that developing a full featured core like POWER can be complicated – but that’s not necessarily the case. In fact, we believe the open source community can leverage the contributions made by IBM rather quickly.

In addition to open sourcing the POWER ISA, IBM is also contributing a newly developed softcore to the community. In a very short time, an IBM engineer was able to develop a softcore on the POWER ISA, and get it up and running on a Xilinx FPGA. This softcore implementation is being demonstrated this week at OpenPOWER Summit North America.

“This is the first tangible outcome of the opening of the POWER ISA,” said Mendy Furmanek, President, OpenPOWER Foundation and Director, OpenPOWER Processor Enablement, IBM. “It’s an example of the type of innovation that can be brought forward by the community as a result of newly open-sourced contributions.”

IBM is also contributing reference designs for OpenCAPI and Open Memory Interface (OMI) to the open source community. OpenPOWER Foundation and OpenCAPI Consortium member Microchip Technology was recently awarded [Best Of Show at Flash Memory Summit 2019](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190807005938/en/Flash-Memory-Summit-Announces-2019-Show-Award) for its newly announced serial memory controller, which leverages interface designs IBM is contributing.

While these designs are architecture-agnostic, they will help to grow and advance the OpenPOWER ecosystem. OpenPOWER Foundation partners including IBM and Google share their perspectives on the news in [Microchip's announcement of the SMC 1000 8x25G.](https://investor.microsemi.com/2019-08-05-Microchip-Enters-Memory-Infrastructure-Market-with-Serial-Memory-Controller-for-High-performance-Data-Center-Computing)

## **Excitement From the OpenPOWER Ecosystem**

We’ve already heard incredibly positive feedback on today's announcements from a number of our partners:

- As the Chairman of the OpenPOWER Foundation Board of Directors, it’s an honor to share in such a tremendous moment with our community. The opening of the POWER ISA and alignment of the OpenPOWER Foundation with the Linux Foundation is a reflection of our mature, sustainable and growing ecosystem. These changes will result in more consortia-driven initiatives and allow more diverse, innovative products and solutions to be brought to market. – Artem Ikoev, Chairman of the OpenPOWER Foundation Board of Directors, Co-founder and CTO, [Yadro](https://yadro.com/)

 

- "Inspur Power Systems has a rich portfolio based on both Power and OpenPOWER that is realizing growth in the China market. Recently, Inspur Power Systems has developed and announced industry-leading OpenPOWER products in storage, datacenter, AI and big data. We receive positive feedback from our customers citing TCO and performance advantages as well as value in the openness of OpenPOWER technology and software stack. Inspur Power Systems is very excited about the possibilities today’s announcements offer to the OpenPOWER ecosystem, our company and of course our clients. We congratulate IBM and the OpenPOWER Foundation for showing leadership in taking these steps." - John Hu, General Manager, [Inspur Power Systems](https://www.inspursystems.com/)

 

- "At Raptor Computing Systems our top priority has always been owner controlled, auditable systems. The release of the POWER ISA is key to making POWER the definitive go-to architecture not only for security-sensitive applications, but for any application that is intended to last. With this single, vital step, Raptor Computing Systems can now offer truly high performance systems with absolutely no compromises on user freedom. Make no mistake, this is a milestone for the industry -- computing as it should have been, and can be again, thanks to IBM's willingness to embrace open systems and Raptor Computing Systems' commitment to owner control.” - Timothy Pearson, CTO, [Raptor Computing Systems](https://www.raptorcs.com/)

 

- “At the University of Oregon, we are committed to supporting the OpenPOWER platform and developing tools that help improve the quality and efficiency of the software developed on this platform. The tools developed at the University of Oregon include the TAU Performance System(R), in use at supercomputing sites around the world, for evaluating the performance of HPC and AI workloads. The release of the POWER ISA is an important milestone in developing the software ecosystem on the OpenPOWER platform.” Sameer Shende, Director, Performance Research Laboratory, [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/)

 

- “Wistron Enterprise Business Group has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with the OpenPOWER Ecosystem and was one of the first members of the OpenPOWER Foundation when we joined in 2014. We understand the many benefits of Open—solutions built on our POWER9  "MiHawk" server has a great combination of high performance and ability to run an entirely open software stack, from firmware to applications. By leveraging POWER9s impressive memory capability, PCIe Gen4, and OpenCAPI technologies this server excels in AI, cloud, and BigData. We're excited to see IBM and the OpenPOWER Foundation take the ecosystem to the next level of openness with the announcements today and are already considering how we can best leverage this for the benefit of our customers. ” - William Lin, President, Enterprise Business Group, [Wistron](https://www.wistron.com/CMS/ChangeLanguage/3)
