### Abstract

The hybrid CPU-GPU architecture is one of the main tracks for dealing with the power limitations imposed on high performance computing systems. It is expected that large leadership computing facilities will, for the foreseeable future, deploy systems with this design to address science and engineering challenges for government, academia, and industry. Consistent with this trend, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) has signed a contract with IBM to bring a next-generation supercomputer to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2017. This new supercomputer, named Summit, will provide on science applications at least five times the performance of Titan, the OLCF's current hybrid CPU+GPU leadership system, and become the next peak in leadership-class computing systems for open science. In response to a call for proposals, the OLCF has selected and will be partnering with science and engineering application development teams for the porting and optimization of their applications and carrying out a science campaign at scale on Summit.
