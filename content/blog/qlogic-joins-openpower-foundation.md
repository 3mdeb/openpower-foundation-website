ALISO VIEJO, Calif., Oct. 8, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QLogic Corp. (Nasdaq:QLGC), a leading supplier of high performance network infrastructure solutions, today announced that it has joined the OpenPOWER Foundation, an open development community based on the POWER microprocessor architecture.

QLogic joins a growing roster of technology organizations working collaboratively to build advanced server, networking, storage and acceleration technology to enable those responsible for data centers to rethink their approach to technology. The OpenPOWER Foundation aims at delivering more choice, control and flexibility to developers of next-generation, hyperscale and cloud data centers. The group makes POWER hardware and software available to open development for the first time, as well as making POWER intellectual property licensable to others, greatly expanding the ecosystem of innovators on the platform.

"QLogic is looking forward to working with OpenPOWER member organizations to deliver our unique brand of innovation to the market. Today's demand for cloud-based services, along with the growing popularity of connected, mobile devices, require data center architectures to deliver incredible scalability, flexibility and performance," said Vikram Karvat, vice president of marketing, QLogic. "As a market leader in Fibre Channel and Ethernet adapters and the industry's frontrunner in innovative data center I/O solutions, QLogic will enhance functionality for highly virtualized, open standards-based, cloud and web-scale data centers based on the IBM POWER platform."

The OpenPOWER Foundation aims to drive expansion of enterprise-class, data center hardware and software, giving the industry greater ability to innovate across the POWER platform. The OpenPOWER ecosystem enables customers to build best-in-class systems finely tuned to the POWER architecture.

"The development model of the OpenPOWER Foundation is one based on collaboration and represents a new way of innovating around processor technology for big data and cloud," said Brad McCredie, president, OpenPOWER Foundation. "With QLogic joining this initiative we have significantly expanded our base of technology providers, as they bring a wealth of high performance networking and storage expertise, technology and innovation ability to OpenPOWER, allowing us to capitalize on emerging workloads."

### QLogic Gen 5 Fibre Channel Adapters: Greater Security, Reliability and Scalability

QLogic Gen 5 Fibre Channel adapters are designed to tackle high bandwidth, I/O-intensive applications, such as virtualization, streaming media, online transaction processing, big data analytics and data warehousing where reliability is critical. The underlying driver stack in QLogic Gen 5 Fibre Channel technology is proven in more than 15 million ports shipped to enterprise data centers around the world.

The QLogic dual-port ASIC is designed with the company's unique multi-port traffic isolation feature for greater reliability and security on dual-port models. This unique architecture, with complete on-chip CPU and memory isolation across both ports of the adapter, ensures that if one port should encounter issues, the second, isolated port will continue to function securely and without interruption. With two independent channels, I/O imbalances, error recovery or firmware updates on one port do not impact the second port. This enables the adapter to offer secure, deterministically predictive and scalable port performance and increased reliability. This is essential for enterprise data centers—assuring the highest levels of availability for mission-critical applications.

### QLogic Ethernet Adapter Solutions: High Performance with Flexibility

By delivering high performance Ethernet with low CPU utilization, QLogic adapters excel in virtualized environments. Featuring multiple protocol offload and concurrent LAN (TCP/IP) and SAN (FCoE, iSCSI) protocol processing over a shared Ethernet link, QLogic adapters offer maximum flexibility. Ultra-low CPU utilization frees up server cycles for business-critical applications and the increased mobility of virtual machines (VMs). QLogic QConvergeConsole™ adds multi-platform, single-pane-of-glass management of FCoE, iSCSI and TCP/IP protocols for ease-of-administration and converged network deployment.
