![5](images/5-1024x512.jpg)I’m pleased to announce the publication of Cabot Partners’ new Whitepaper, [HPC and HPDA for the Cognitive Journey with OpenPOWER](http://ibm.co/29wENZQ).  An update to last year’s [Crossing the Performance CHASM with OpenPOWER](https://openpowerfoundation.org/blogs/crossing-the-performance-chasm-with-openpower/), our latest analysis captures the progress and continuing momentum of the OpenPOWER Foundation and the evolution of its accelerated computing roadmap. In particular, we find the data-centric design of OpenPOWER systems to be uniquely suited to deliver on the next game-changing business opportunity – the convergence of HPC and Big Data Analytics across enterprise and research computing, coupled with the power of Deep Learning to derive the next level of value in today’s data-fueled economy.

Whether you’re a business striving to improve customer experience and loyalty or a research institution in pursuit of increasingly valuable results, adopting infrastructure designed to learn from its own information and return insightful, actionable results – a Cognitive infrastructure – will become the key to advancement. With real-world examples across multiple industries, we highlight the need for clients to evaluate systems based on performance of complete, data-driven workflows and show how adopting high-value offerings from the OpenPOWER Foundation featuring data-centric design can help lower costs and accelerate time-to-insight on your journey to becoming a Cognitive business.
