![Tyan reference Board](images/Tyan-reference-Board-300x180.jpg) We are excited with the progress that the OpenPOWER Foundation member companies have made since our public launch in San Francisco back in April. Members can now request early access to the Tyan reference board shown below by emailing [Bernice Tsai](mailto:bernice.tsai@mic.com.tw) at Tyan. This is a single socket, ATX form factor, Power8 Motherboard that can members can bring up an [Debian Linux Distribution](https://wiki.debian.org/ppc64el) (Little Endian) to start innovating with. We look forward to seeing the great ideas that will be generated by working together!
