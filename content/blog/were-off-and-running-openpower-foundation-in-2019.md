We're barely into March and already 2019 is shaping up to be an amazing year for OpenPOWER.

The list of events we’ve taken part in around the world in just two short months is long. Multiple sessions ([including a lightning talk by yours truly](https://youtu.be/sMjRuqCNZe4?t=2360)) at [linux.conf.au](https://2019.linux.conf.au/) in Christchurch, New Zealand and AI Workshops in Mangalore, Barcelona and Tokyo.

Two more events in India (Bangalore and Chennai) before a trip to San Francisco for IBM Think where we had a booth showing off developer systems from [Raptor](https://www.raptorcs.com/). As an aside, Raptor's entry level motherboard, the [Blackbird](https://raptorcs.com/BB/) even got a bit of [Instagram attention](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt4fbSVjtfY/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) from Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips. At Think, OpenPOWER President Michelle Rankin and I also had the opportunity to do a presentation introducing OpenPOWER to audiences.

And this month we’re not slowing down. You'll see OpenPOWER booths at both the [Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLEx 17](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/17x)) and the [Open Compute Project Global Summit](https://www.opencompute.org/summit/global-summit) in Pasadena and San Jose, Calif., respectively, as well as workshops from Sweden to Singapore and from Vermont to North Carolina. More details can be [found here](https://openpowerfoundation.org/events/).

Our other big news is a major revamp of the [OpenPOWER Foundation website](https://openpowerfoundation.org/). The new site includes a Forums area where members of the OpenPOWER ecosystem can collaborate on everything from deep technical matters to end user solutions. Our thanks to [Scot Schultz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scotschultz/) for his tireless efforts in leading the website revamp.

While we’re certainly keeping busy in the first half of the year with events, we’re also really excited about what the second half of the year will bring when we host our U.S., Europe and Asia Summits. We’re well underway in planning these signature events, check our social channels for updates.

As you can see, we’ve had a busy first two months of 2019, and we can’t wait to keep the momentum going with our members for the entire year!

P.S. Keep an eye on the [Forums](https://openpowerfoundation.org/groups/) on the OpenPOWER site next week – might even be some prizes on offer…
