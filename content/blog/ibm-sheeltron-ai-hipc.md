[HiPC 2018](https://hipc.org/) – the 25th edition of the IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data and Analytics – was held in December, 2018 in India. The conference served as a forum for researchers from around the world to present work, and to highlight high performance computing activities in Asia. The meeting focused on all aspects of high performance computing systems and their scientific, engineering and commercial applications.

IBM participated in the conference and showcased artificial intelligence solutions on IBM systems running Power9 processors with Nvidia GPU cards. IBM also supported Sheeltron Digital Systems Pvt. Ltd. with including a booth in the HiPC Showcase.

IBM’s cloud instance showcased artificial intelligence solutions like vehicle driving automation and machine learning. It was a great opportunity to explain the advantages of IBM’s Power9 processor architecture with its high memory bandwidth, CAPI and NVLink, as well as high processor clock speeds and higher cache memory.
