The only constant to being involved with the OpenPOWER Foundation is change and innovation, and there is plenty happening! For instance, OpenPOWER members IBM and NVIDIA just launched a new set of servers [built for the cognitive and AI-driven age](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/ibm-nvidia-present-nvlink-server-youve-waiting/). Now it's time for the focus to turn to Europe with the upcoming OpenPOWER European Summit, beginning 26 October through 28 October.

Our membership and activities in Europe have continued to grow along with our efforts all over the world! This is your chance to find out the latest and hear the latest announcements from our members on how they’re driving the OpenPOWER ecosystem.

Register for free today to join us for:

- 20 keynotes from STFC Hartree Centre, AT&T, OpenStack, Kolab, NVidia, Mellanox, Kinetica, E4 and more to be announced.
- 22 breakout sessions featuring OPF members and OpenStack on OpenPOWER demonstrations.
- Numerous workgroup, Birds of a Feather and Panel sessions.
