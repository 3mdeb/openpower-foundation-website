In the latest announcement _(**[UK Government Invests £115 Million in Big Data and Cognitive Computing Research with STFC and IBM](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47056.wss)**)_, the [STFC Hartree Center](http://www.stfc.ac.uk/2512.aspx) is setting out to enable the latest in world-class, state-of-the-art technologies for the development of advanced software solutions to solve real world challenges in academe, industry and Government and tackle the ever growing issues of big data.

The architecture will include POWER CPUs from IBM, the latest in flash-memory storage, GPU’s from Nvidia and of course the most advanced networking technology from Mellanox.  Enhanced with native support for CAPI technology, and network-offload acceleration capabilities, the Mellanox interconnect will rapidly shuttle data around the system in the most effective and efficient manner to keep the cores focused on crunching the data; not on processing network communications.

Since the inception of the OpenPOWER Foundation, Mellanox has been an active Platinum member with shared goals to collaborate with technology leaders and end users around the world to develop hardware and software solutions that are far superior in tackling the ever changing complexities of today’s problem-sets.

Hartree Centre, a well-established source of innovation with leading computational scientists, data scientists and software developers will now have the leading edge capabilities to help them produce better outcomes to the challenges they tackle every day. For example, the Hartree Centre is already helping businesses like Unilever and Glaxo SmithKline use high performance computing to improve the stability of home products such as fabric softeners and to pinpoint links between genes and diseases.

We are excited for this latest collaboration and look forward to the great work that is to come from Hartree Centre as well as the OpenPOWER Foundation.
