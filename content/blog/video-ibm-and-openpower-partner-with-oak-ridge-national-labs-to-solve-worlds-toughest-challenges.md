The mission of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is to deliver scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs that will accelerate the development and deployment of solutions in clean energy and global security, and in doing so create economic opportunity for the nation. By partnering with OpenPOWER, we are using the next generation POWER and GPU processor technologies to build Summit, a supercomputer that will have 5x-10x greater performance than today's leadership systems.

With Summit in place, ORNL will be able to better focus our scientific and technical expertise and apply our leadership-class data and compute infrastructure to solve some of the greatest challenges of our time. We will be able to provide new insights related to climate change, understand the molecular machinery of the brain, better control combustion for cleaner running engines and perform a full physics simulation of ITER to improve performance of the fusion of this reactor.

To learn more, watch this behind the scenes look at the process here at ORNL.
