Hi OpenPOWER Foundation members,

Weâ€™re excited to announce our first Twitter chat on Thursday, March 1 at 3:00 p.m. ET.

Here are some of details you should know:

- The chat will be hosted right on our [@OpenPOWERorg](https://twitter.com/openpowerorg?lang=en) Twitter page
- We will have two special guest hosts, Hugh Blemings, Executive Director and Robbie Williamson, Chair of the Board.
- You can join the conversation using #[OpenPOWERchat](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23openpowerchat&src=typd)

The conversation will kick off at 3 PM ET, so please drop in and answer as many or as few questions as you can.

Our chat will focus on the upcoming [OpenPOWER Summit](https://openpowerfoundation.org/summit-2018-03-us/) and the innovations and collaboration that OpenPOWER members have developed for the conference.
