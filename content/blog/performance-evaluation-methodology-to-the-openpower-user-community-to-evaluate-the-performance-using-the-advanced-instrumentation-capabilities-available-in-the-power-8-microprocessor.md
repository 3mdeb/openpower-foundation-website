### Presentation Objective

The primary objective of this presentation is to provide a performance evaluation methodology to the OpenPower user community to evaluate the performance using the advanced instrumentation capabilities available in the Power 8 Microprocessor. And also to present a case study on how CPI stack cycle accounting model can be effectively used to evaluate the performance of SPEC 2006 workloads in various SMT modes.

### Abstract

This presentation has been split into two sections. In the first section of the presentation we will primarily cover the key Performance Instrumentation capabilities of the Power 8 Microprocessor and how it can be effectively utilized to understand and resolve the performance bottlenecks in the Code. This will cover in detail the CPI stack cycle accounting model of Power 8 microprocessor and how this is different from the previous Power 7 processor architecture. The improvements which went into the POWER 8 CPI Stack cycle accounting which help CPI cycle accounting very precise.

In the second section of the presentation we will cover the Single Core SMT performance analysis of the SPEC 2006 workloads on the POWER 8 microprocessor. We will also discuss a performance evaluation methodology used to evaluate the performance of SMT. We will describe in detail how the CPI stack building for various SMT levels will help us root cause the key performance bottlenecks in the code at the higher SMT levels and how this can be attributed effectively to the different units of the microprocessor.
