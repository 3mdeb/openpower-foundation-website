Earlier this month, the [Institute of Engineering & Management](http://iem.edu.in/) in Kolkata, India welcomed OpenPOWER experts and novices to a full day workshop to discuss how to use IBM POWER systems for big data analysis and artificial intelligence applications. 

More than 200 participants from around Kolkata attended; attendees included not only students and faculty from local universities, but also professionals from the stateâ€™s Ministry of Higher Education. 

After an introduction to the OpenPOWER platform, partners and researchers across industries shared their experience using IBM POWER to support genomics programs, image analytics and more. [Professor Arghya Kusum Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arghya-kusum-das-567a4761/) from the University of Wisconsin at Platteville, for example, walked attendees through how he utilizes POWER to handle terabytes of metagenomic data (see the white paper [here](https://www.lsu.edu/mediacenter/docs/LSU-IBM_POWER8_GenomeBenchmark.pdf)).

Another crowd-favorite session was the Introduction to Watson Machine Learning Acceleration (WML-A). Participants got hands-on experience with WML-A through [JupyterLab Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) .

Please see the full workshop on [YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GYH69Yr75h4).

If you are interested in attending a similar session, we are looking to schedule more worldwide, including in India and the U.S. Be sure to also check out [OpenPOWER Summit 2019 Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/openpower-summit-eu-2019/), happening next month (October 31-November 1) in Lyons, France!
