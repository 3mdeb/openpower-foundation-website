![OPF logo](images/OPF-logo.jpg)Dear Fellow Innovators,

As the newly elected Chair and President of the OpenPOWER Foundation, we would like to take this opportunity to share our vision as we embark on a busy 2016.  Additionally, we want to make sure our fellow members -- all 175 of us and growing -- are aware of the many opportunities we have to contribute to our vibrant and growing organization.

## Our Vision

First, the vision.  Through an active group of leading technologists, OpenPOWER in its first two formative years built a strong technical foundation -- developing the literal bedrock of hardware and software building blocks required to enable end users to take advantage of POWER's open architecture.  With several jointly developed OpenPOWER-based servers already in market, a [growing network](http://developers.openpowerfoundation.org/) of physical and cloud-based test servers and a wide range of other [resources and tools](https://openpowerfoundation.org/technical/technical-resources/) now available to developers around the world, we have a strong technical base.  We are now moving into our next phase: scaling the OpenPOWER ecosystem.  How will we do this?  With an unwavering commitment to optimize as many workloads on the POWER architecture as possible.

It is in this vein that we have identified our top three priorities for 2016:

1. **Tackle system bottlenecks** through collaboration on memory bandwidth, acceleration, and interconnect advances.
2. **Grow workloads** **and software community** optimizing on OpenPOWER.
3. **Further OpenPOWER’s validation through adoption** conveyed via member and end user testimonials, benchmarking, and industry influencer reports.

As employees of Canonical and IBM, and active participants in OpenPOWER activities stemming back to the early days, we share a deep commitment to open ecosystems as a driver for meaningful innovation.  Combining Canonical's leadership with growing software applications on the POWER architecture with IBM's base commitment to open development on top of the POWER architecture at all levels of the stack, we stand ready to help lead an even more rapid expansion of the OpenPOWER ecosystem in 2016.  This commitment, however, extends well beyond Canonical and IBM to across the entire [Board leadership](https://openpowerfoundation.org/about-us/board-of-directors/), which continues to reflect the diversity of our membership.  Two of the original founders of OpenPOWER -- our outgoing chair Gordon MacKean of Google and president Brad McCredie with IBM -- will remain close and serve as non-voting Board Advisors, providing guidance on a wide range of technical and strategic activities as needed. To read Gordon MacKean's perspective on OpenPOWER's growth, we encourage you to read his [personal Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/112847999124594649509/posts/PDcmTZzsHDg).

In driving OpenPOWER’s vision forward, we are fortunate to have at our disposal not just our formal leadership team, but a deep bench of talent throughout the entire organization – you – literally dozens of the world's leading technologists representing all levels of the technology stack across the globe. With your support behind us as, we're sure the odds are stacked in our favor and we can't wait to get started.

## Get Involved

So, now that you've heard our vision for 2016, how can you get involved?
