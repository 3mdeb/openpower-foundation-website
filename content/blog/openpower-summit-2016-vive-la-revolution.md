The OpenPOWER Foundation's model of [open collaboration between organizations](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544321/competing-billion-dollar-tech-companies-are-joining-forces-heres-why/) has flipped the script and spawned an incredibly engaged community. We’re not adjusting the dial, we’re leveling the playing field and changing the game for both open software and hardware. This is a revolution for our industry.

Hear from vendors like Mellanox, NVIDIA, Tyan, Nallatech, and IBM on their latest hardware innovations. See how MSPs like Rackspace, Arrow ECS, and Redis Labs are bringing OpenPOWER into the cloud. Get hands on with Canonical and Ubuntu to experience how OpenPOWER is built upon the leading open source operating system, Linux, and how we’re embracing and practicing the ideals of open source.

We invite you to join us at the [OpenPOWER Summit](https://openpowerfoundation.org/openpower-summit-2016/) where you can:

- see over 50 presenters and speakers share their OpenPOWER-driven innovation including talks from end users as well as hardware and software innovators,
- visit a show floor of demos to understand OpenPOWER innovations in action,
- network with your peers at the OpenPOWER Pavilion Theater to embrace the open spirit of collaboration,
- join  our ISV Roundtable to hear from cross-industry leaders about how OpenPOWER is accelerating their business,
