### Abstract

It’s been nearly a year since the public launch of OpenPower and the community of technology leaders that make up our community have made significant progress towards our original goals. While growth of the membership is a critical factor, our success will come from the technology provided through the ‘open model’ and the ‘value’ solutions that are enabled by leveraging that technology. Please join us as we highlight the key components that our member community have contributed to that ‘open model’ and spotlight some examples of high value solutions enabled through members leveraging our combined capabilities and strengths.
