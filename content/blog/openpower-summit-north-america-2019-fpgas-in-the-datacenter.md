FPGAs have been in the data center for a long time - so when we talk about them today, what we’re really discussing is the new way that FPGAs are being applied in computing. 

At OpenPOWER Summit North America in August, Nimbix CEO Steve Hebert dove deeper into the history of FPGAs, starting in the ‘80s and ‘90s to today, where we are seeing them at hyperscale. Building purpose-driven FPGA hardware for individual workloads - at hyperscale - allows us to process information even faster with the flexibility and reconfigurability FPGAs provide. This is key as the computing ecosystem leans even heavier into cloud and workloads such as machine learning and big data processing.
