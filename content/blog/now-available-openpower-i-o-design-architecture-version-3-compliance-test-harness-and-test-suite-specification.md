The Compliance Work Group recently completed the [OpenPOWER I/O Design Architecture, version 3 (IODA3) Compliance Test Harness and Test Suite (TH/TS) Specification](https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=i-o-design-architecture-ioda3-compliance-test-harness-and-test-suite-th-ts-review-draft). The input to the compliance specification is the [OpenPOWER I/O Design Architecture, version 3 (IODA3) Specification](https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=openpower-io-design-architecture-ioda-specification-review-draft) which describes the chip architecture for key aspects of PCI Express® (PCIe)-based host bridge (PHB) designs for POWER9™ systems. This specification defines the PHB hardware and firmware requirements for the functions shown in the following diagram.

The purpose of the OpenPOWER IODA3 Compliance TH/TS Specification is to provide the test suite requirements to be able to demonstrate OpenPOWER IODA3 compliance for POWER9™ systems. It describes the required and optional tests needed in the test suite to ensure compliance and compatibility for each of the functions in the previous diagram.

Both documents are available on the OpenPOWER Foundation Technical Resources web page. Comments and questions on the IODA3 specification can be submitted to the public mailing list at [hwarch-ioda@mailinglist.openpowerfoundation.org](mailto:hwarch-ioda@mailinglist.openpowerfoundation.org). If you have comments you would like to make on the OpenPOWER IODA3 Compliance TH/TS Specification, you can submit them to the Compliance Work Group public mailing list at [openpower-ioda-thts@mailinglist.openpowerfoundation.org](mailto:openpower-ioda-thts@mailinglist.openpowerfoundation.org).
