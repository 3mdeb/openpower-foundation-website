It was great to attend the [OpenPOWER Summit Europe](https://openpowerfoundation.org/summit-2018-10-eu/) in Amsterdam earlier this month. As an academia member from a medical background, it was the first completely technical forum I had attended at an international level.

The [PES Institute of Medical Sciences](http://pesimsr.pes.edu/), India has been working with IBM and the OpenPOWER community recently on developing AI solutions for patient care in our rural facility. We are a tertiary care teaching institute catering to a rural population of around one million. I attended the OpenPOWER Summit Europe to discuss the need and opportunity for deploying AI solutions in our work.

AI in health care was a featured theme throughout the OpenPOWER Summit Europe. Professor Florin Manaila demonstrated solutions he has worked on for breast cancer diagnosis and grading using image processing. And Professor Antonio Liotta spoke about machine learning and AI-related research in his lab.

The AI4Good Hackathon invited researchers from across the world to find solutions for health challenges â€“ particularly in cancer care. I was glad to see students from India and Europe participating.

I look forward to networking with other academic and industry teams to work on further developing model training and implementation. Through collaboration, institutions can partner together to secure funding and innovate toward a brighter future.
