**Xilinx Participation at OpenPOWER Summit 2015**

**Wednesday, March 18 at 3:55PM**

**_"Key-Value Store Acceleration with OpenPOWER_**_" by Michaela Blott, Senior Staff Research Engineer, Xilinx_

- This presentation discusses the architecture of an accelerated key-value store appliance which leverages a novel data-flow implementation of Memcached on an FPGA. The design achieves up to 36X in performance and power at response times in the microsecond range. Coherent integration of memory through IBM's Power8 CAPI interface allows both host memory and coherent-attached flash to be used as the value store.

**_"Data Center and Cloud Computing Market Landscape and Challenges_**" _by Manoj Roge, Director of Wired and Data Center Solutions, Xilinx_

- This presentation discusses data center and cloud computing market landscapes, examines technology challenges that limit scaling of cloud computing and delivers insights into how FPGAs combined with general purpose processors are transforming next-generation data centers with tremendous compute horsepower, low-latency and extreme power efficiency.

**Technical Demonstrations in Xilinx Booth #913**

- **Key Value Store Application Acceleration Solution** Xilinx is showcasing a Key Value Store (KVS) application acceleration demo leveraging the Alpha Data ADM-PCIE-7V3 board and OpenPOWER's coherent accelerator processor interface (CAPI). This demonstration is a broadly applicable KVS workload acceleration engine delivering performance/watt acceleration at lower latency.
- **Convey Computer Corporation OpenPOWER-based Acceleration Solution** Convey Computer Corporation will be showing its Eagle co-processor, a PCIe® form factor add-in card that utilizes Xilinx FPGAs to deliver application-specific acceleration for data-intensive applications. Eagle co-processors are IBM Power8 CAPI capable, and incorporate a Xilinx Virtex-7 X980T FPGA with four on-board SO-DIMMs for local data storage. OpenPOWER systems with Eagle co-processors provide an ideal solution for big data and high performance computing applications.
