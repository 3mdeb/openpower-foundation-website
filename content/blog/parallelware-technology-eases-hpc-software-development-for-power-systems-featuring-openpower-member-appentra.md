The 3rd OpenPOWER Academic Discussion Group Workshop was a great meeting of more than 40 developers, researchers and partners all working on Power. I’ve already summarized two sessions led by speakers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory – [Early Application Experiences on Summit](https://openpowerfoundation.org/blogs/early-application-experiences-summit-oak-ridge/) and [Targeting GPUs using OpenMP Directives on Summit](https://openpowerfoundation.org/blogs/targeting-gpus-using-openmp-directives/).

[Manuel Arenaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelarenaz/), CEO and co-founder of [Appentra](https://www.appentra.com/), led a session designed to answer an important question: is there a need for parallelware tools on POWER systems? According to Arenaz, there is of course incredible computational power in even a single node of a Power-based supercomputer like [Summit](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/). But there are also a number of parallel programming challenges:

- Parallel programming of many-core processors
- Parallel programming of multiple GPUs
- Data movement through a heterogeneous complex memory hierarchy
- Training of computational researchers and engineers
- Porting of existing codes to pre-exascale systems

Appentra’s efforts to make code parallel and help developers make the most of high performance computing resources can help solve these challenges. [Parallelware Trainer](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-trainer/) is an interactive tool that acts as a virtual mentor to provide faster, more effective learning. And [Parallelware Analyzer](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-analyzer/) (still in beta) is a command-line reporting tool to improve productivity of HPC application developers.

Appentra plans to certify both Parallelware tools as [OpenPOWER Ready](https://openpowerfoundation.org/technical/openpower-ready/) in 2019.

For more detail on the product roadmap of Parallelware Trainer and Parallelware Analyzer, view Arenaz’ full session video and slides below.
