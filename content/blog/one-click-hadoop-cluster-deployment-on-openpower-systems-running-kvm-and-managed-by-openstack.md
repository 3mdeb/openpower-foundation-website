Hadoop workloads are memory and compute intensive and Power servers are best choice for hadoop workloads.  The Power servers are first processor designed to accelerate big data workloads.

We implemented PowerKVM based Hadoop cluster solution on Power Systems and validated performance of teradata workload on PowerKVM virtual machines, to ensure consolidation of Hadoop workloads on  PowerKVM. This paper covers how capabilities of Open Power & Openstack simplify deployment of Hadoop Solution on Power Virtual machines. Also would like to share VM & Hadoop cluster configuration which yields better performance

This presentation talks about "One-click hadoop cluster deployment on OpenPower systems running KVM and managed by Openstack"
