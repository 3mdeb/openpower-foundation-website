Since its inception, the OpenPOWER Foundation has been dedicated to fostering a collaborative environment to drive meaningful hardware and software innovation.  As part of that commitment, OpenPOWER today launched a valuable new asset for developers:  [OpenPOWER Developer Tools](https://openpowerfoundation.org/technical/technical-resources/openpower-developer-tools/).

Available on the [Technology Resources](https://openpowerfoundation.org/technical/technical-resources/) section of the [OpenPOWER website](https://openpowerfoundation.org/), OpenPOWER Developer Tools is a quintessential starting place for developers looking to participate in OpenPOWER's growing ecosystem.  The tool kits and other resources – made available by our members – include a variety of hardware, software and other technical resources that will enable developers to more quickly leverage POWER's open architecture to build solutions that follow OpenPOWER's design concept.

Current tools and technical assets available include: Tyan's OpenPOWER customer reference system, Nallatech's CAPI Developer Kit, a software developer toolkit for Linux on POWER, access to IBM's Power Development Cloud and more.  And, with a membership over 90 members and counting, we expect to post additional tools on an ongoing basis ... so check back often!
