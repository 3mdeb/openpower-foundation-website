At the University of Oregon, we’ve been looking at the problem of performance engineering of complex PowerAI applications. The [TAU Performance System](http://tau.uoregon.edu)® is a performance profiling and tracing toolkit that we developed, and it has been successfully applied to evaluate the performance of PowerAI components.

I recently had the chance to share early results in my session “TAU for Accelerating AI Applications” at the [OpenPOWER Summit Europe 2018](https://openpowerfoundation.org/summit-2018-10-eu/).

At OpenPOWER Summit Europe, researchers presented state-of-the-art approaches to running AI workloads on OpenPOWER systems. PowerAI is a powerful software stack. And, running larger datasets on it with TAU will enhance our understanding of the complex inner workings of the interplay between Power9 CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.
