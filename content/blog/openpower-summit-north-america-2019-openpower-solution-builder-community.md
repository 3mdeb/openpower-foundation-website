Do you design on and maintain POWER and OpenPOWER solution stacks? Are you looking for a community of POWER builders to exchange ideas with? The OpenPOWER Solution Builder Community might be just what you’re looking for. 

Two members of the Community, [Christopher Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-m-sullivan-446904/), an Assistant Director for Biocomputing at Oregon State University, and [John Pace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pace-phd-20b87070), Senior Data Scientist for Mark III Systems, stopped by OpenPOWER Summit North America in August to share insight into the group’s functions. 

Aimed at those who design, implement, operate and maintain POWER and OpenPOWER solution stacks, the group is self-governing and provides a means for builders to share insights and innovation. The Community serves three main functions:

1. A place to ask and answer questions, and provide pointers to relevant information
2. Exchanging of best practices on building hardware-software solution stacks and architectures
3. Collaborate on innovations of applications, libraries, methods and approaches

Right now, the Community is focused on solution stacks around the IBM POWER9 AC922 integrated GPU server, but they have plans to expand to additional systems and workloads!
