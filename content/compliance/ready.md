The OpenPOWER Foundation set up the OpenPOWER Ready™ program in 2016.
Within the program, developers identify products for use by members of the OpenPOWER ecosystem.
The OpenPOWER Ready mark indicates that a product should work with other OpenPOWER Ready products.
Because of this the OpenPOWER Foundation is suggesting that entities providing such products join the foundation.  

Companies and other entities can make a strong statement about their support of the OpenPOWER technology
as an alternative to other computing solutions by becoming a member of the OpenPOWER Foundation membership.  

The OpenPOWER Ready Definition and Criteria document describes the details of the program.
Since there are several types of products categorized in the document they are listed below.
Because of the differences between the categories of products the criteria varies between them.
Developers will find the categories and criteria described in the document.
