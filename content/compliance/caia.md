The purpose of the OpenPOWER CAPI Accelerator Compliance Test Specification is
to provide the test suite requirements to demonstrate OpenPOWER CAPI Accelerator solution compliance for POWERâ„¢ systems.
The input to this specification are the following specifications which define the hardware interfaces which are the subject of
this OpenPOWER CAPI Accelerator Compliance document:

- OpenPOWER Power Service Layer (PSL) to Accelerator Function Unit (AFU) Interface CAPI Specification,
  which describes the interface to communicate to the acceleration logic running on the FPGA.
- OpenPOWER Coherent Accelerator Interface Architecture Version (CAIA) Specification
  which describes a coherent accelerator interface structure for coherently attaching accelerators to the POWER systems using a standard PCIe bus.
  

This document is a Standard Track, Work Group Specification work product owned by the Compliance Workgroup and
handled in compliance with the requirements outlined in the OpenPOWER Foundation Work Group (WG) Process document.
