The purpose of the OpenPOWER Advanced Accelerator Adapter Compliance 25Gbps I/O Test Harness and Test Suite specification is
to provide the test suite requirements to demonstrate OpenPOWER Advanced Accelerator Adapter 25G I/O compliance for POWER9â„¢ systems.  

The input to this specification is the following specification :
OpenPOWER Advanced Accelerator Adapter Electro-Mechanical Specification
which describes electro-mechanical specification for advanced accelerator adapters within the OpenPOWER ecosystem supported by IBM POWER9.  

There are two accelerator approaches for the 25Gbit/sec interface and
the compliance for each approach is defined in this document.
The first approach is a Mezzanine Adapter Card which is attached to the system planar via two connectors.
The Mezzanine Adapter Card for OpenPOWER systems based on the POWER9 processor attaches to the 25Gbit/sec interface native to
the POWER9 and plugs into the mezzanine card connectors.  

The second approach is a Cabled Interface Extension to an adapter card.
It uses a PCIe card as an example but the cabled extension does not require the adapter card be PCIe.
POWER9 platforms support the optional cabling of the 25Gbit/sec Advanced Accelerator Interface to
the advanced accelerator adapter in a riser card plugged into a PCIe slot in the same system.
In addition, the adapter could be located in different drawer of the rack.  

This document is a Standard Track, Work Group Specification work product owned by the Compliance Workgroup and
handled in compliance with the requirements outlined in the OpenPOWER Foundation Work Group (WG) Process document.
