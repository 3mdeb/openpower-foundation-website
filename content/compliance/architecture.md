The purpose of the OpenPOWER Architecture Compliance Definition document is to give a consistent approach
to compliance under the guidance of the Compliance Work Group.  

It contains the following :
- Document the OpenPOWER specifications that contain the interfaces that are required to be OpenPOWER compliant
- Document an overview of the Compliance Test Harness and Test Suite Specifications that have been developed in the Compliance Work Group,
  and an outline of the contents expected in each specification
- Document procedures on how to measure and document compliance and where to submit the report for compliance

Version 1.1.0 of the document is based on the POWER8™ systems and the POWER9™ systems and
reflects work by the Compliance Work Group to improve the document.  

The OpenPOWER Architecture Compliance Definition document is a Standards Track, Work Group Specification owned by the Compliance Workgroup and
handled in compliance with the requirements outlined in the OpenPOWER Foundation Work Group (WG) Process document.
