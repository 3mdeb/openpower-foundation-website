The OpenPOWER Foundation has overhauled its entire infrastructure to better serve the needs of our community.
We have implemented a number of new systems that will make it easier for both members and non-members to engage
and collaborate with the OpenPOWER Foundation.
All of the systems OpenPOWER Foundation uses are fully Open Source Software running on POWER servers.  

This quick guide provides the community an introduction to our infrastructure and communication channels and how to easily engage.
