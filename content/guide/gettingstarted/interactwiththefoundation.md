The main area of collaboration occurs within our Workgroups.
The [Workgroup page](/groups/) lists out the current OpenPOWER Foundation working groups.

Clicking on one of the workgroups brings you to the main area explaining what the workgroup focuses on,
who is the current chair, along with the associated resource links to engage.
Depending on the workgroup these links might be private for members only and will require you to login using your OpenPOWER Passport ID.

Participation in the development and decision-making process is open to anybody in the technical community.
We strongly encourage developers to engage with our projects directly on a technical level.
