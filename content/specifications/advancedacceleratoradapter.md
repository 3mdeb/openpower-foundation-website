The Advanced Accelerator Adapter Electro-Mechanical Specification defines an electro-mechanical specification for
advanced accelerator adapters within the OpenPOWER eco-system supported by IBM® POWER9™.
POWER9 modules present a 25Gbps interface organized into groups of 8 bit-lanes.
Innovation within the community is encouraged for systems that support accelerated computing and
the accelerator adapters needed to make heterogeneous / accelerated computing solutions available to the market.  

This specification defines two accelerator approaches.
The first approach is a mezzanine card attached to the system planar via two connectors.
This approach is defined in Part I: Mezzanine Adapter Card.  

The second approach is via cable and is defined in Cabled Interface Extension.
While the accelerator card form factor is not defined in this specification Part II : Cabled Interface Extension assumes a PCIe® card for illustration.  

The electrical characteristics of the 25Gbps channel are defined in Part III: 25 Gbit/sec Electrical Channel.
