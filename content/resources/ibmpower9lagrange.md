The IBM POWER9 LaGrange is based on IBM® Power Architecture®, IBM POWER9 systems target technical computing segments
by providing superior floating-point performance and off-chip floating-point acceleration.
POWER9 systems, which consist of superscalar multiprocessors that are massively multithreaded, support Cloud operating environments.
With the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) attached, POWER9 systems offer a robust platform for analytics and big data applications.  

The POWER9 LaGrange module has the following key characteristics: 68.5 mm x 68.5 mm, FC-PLGA, 8 DDR4, 42 PCIe Lanes and 2 XBus 4B
