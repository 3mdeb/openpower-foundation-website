IBMâ€™s CAPI technology provides a high-performance, coherent processor attach for computation-heavy algorithms on an FPGA.
This innovation removes the overhead and complexity of the I/O subsystem,
allowing an accelerator to operate as part of an application with a smaller programming investment.
The CAPI Developer Kit is now available through OpenPOWER member Nallatech.
Nallatech provides the CAPI FPGA Card, documentation, software, and support required to implement a CAPI solution.
