The IBM POWER8 Turismo CPU is based on IBM速 Power Architecture速, IBM速 POWER8速 systems are optimized for the cloud, big data, and analytics.
They consist of superscalar multiprocessors that are massively multithreaded.
POWER8 systems incorporate the high-speed differential POWER8 memory buffer, which supports several DDR technologies.
POWER8 systems use the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) to attach specialized processors,
and permit them direct access to the memory address space.
