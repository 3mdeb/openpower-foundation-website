The POWER8 Dellovo is based on IBM® Power Architecture®, IBM® POWER8® with NVIDIA® NVLink™ Technology systems are designed
for use in high-performance computing (HPC) and data analytics systems.
They consist of superscalar multiprocessors that are massively multithreaded.
The NVLink interconnect enables ultra-fast communication between the central processing unit (CPU) and
the graphics processing unit (GPU) and between GPUs.
POWER8 with NVLink systems incorporate the high-speed differential POWER8 Memory Buffer, which supports several DDR technologies.
